## 🎮 How It Works

JJK Stat Clash is a local multiplayer drafting game where 2–8 players build their ideal sorcerer by selecting entities across **11 stat categories**, then clash to see whose build is stronger.

### Game Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **🚫 Ban Phase** | Each player bans 2 entities from the global pool |
| **📋 Draft Phase** | Players fill 11 slots: Character stats (Strength, Speed, Durability, CE, Body, IQ), Cursed Technique, Tool, Shikigami, Domain Expansion, and 2 Special Powers |
| **⚡ Clash** | Stats are compared head-to-head with synergy bonuses, Black Flash crits, Binding Vow modifiers, and Heavenly Restriction interactions |

### Game Modes

- **Normal Protocol** — Free selection from the entity database
- **Gamble Mode (Cursed Lottery)** — Roll for random entities with a limited number of spins and lucky rolls
